            <!--Introduction Section-->
            <p>Hi! Thank you so much for visiting our page!
            We're very excited you're willing to fully understand and get more educated about the LGBTQIA
            communtiy and the issues they face within our society. Stay a while, everyone is welcome here! :)</p>

            <!--First Section-->
            <div class=WhatIsLGBTQ>
                <h2>What Is The LGBTQ+ Community?</h2>
                <p>LGBTQ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and the "+" in the end is to 
                    recognize others who may not fall under this category (like asexual, alliences, or intersex) 
                    but are still welcome. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Second Section-->
            <div class=WhatIsTheProblem>
                <h2>What Is The Problem?</h2>
                <p>Historically, the LGBTQ+ community has always faced discrimination, prejudice, and persecution
                    within our society. Although we are making great strides in moving past this serious issue, 
                    it's more than clear we have a long way to go. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Third Section-->
            <div class=OurMission>
                <h2>What is our mission?</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to help raise awareness about how you (our beautiful reader!) can help move our
                    society a step closer to a LGBTQ+ friendly community. We have multiple links here where you can
                    donate, and you can learn more about the LGBTQ+ community in the About section of our page.
