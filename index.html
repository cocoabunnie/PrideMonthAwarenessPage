                    Hi! Thank you so much for visiting our page!
                    We decided to make this page in honor of the first of June, which marks the start of Pride Month,
                    where we honor all of those who are a part of the LGBTQ+ community, and the dark history and many 
                    struggles they've had to overcome to be loved, understood, and accepted within our society.
                    We're very excited you're willing to fully understand and get more educated about the LGBTQIA
                    communtiy and the issues they face within our society. Stay a while, everyone is welcome here! :)
                </p>

            <!--First Section-->
            <div class=WhatIsLGBTQ>
                <img src="Art/happyWoman.jpg" width=380px height=300px>
                <div class=WhatIsLGBTQTEXT>
                    <h2>What Is The LGBTQ+ Community?</h2>
                    <p>LGBTQ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and the "+" in the end is to 
                        recognize others who may not fall under these categories (like asexual, alliences, or intersex) 
                        but are still welcome. The community was created to liberate and empower those who identify within
                        these sexualities and give them a space where they can feel welcome, safe, and accepted to express
                        themselves freely in a world that typically doesn't enable them to do so.
                    </p>

            <!--Second Section-->

                <img src="Art/LGBTProtesting.jpg" width=380px height=300px>
                <div class=WhatIsTheProblemTEXT>
                    <h2>What Is The Problem?</h2>
                    <p>Historically, the LGBTQ+ community has always faced discrimination, prejudice, and persecution
                        within our society. Although we are making great strides in moving past this serious issue, 
                        it's more than clear we have a long way to go. 
                    </p>

            <!--Third Section-->
            <div class=OurMission>
                <h2>What is our mission?</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to help raise awareness about how you (our beautiful reader!) can help move our
                    society a step closer to a LGBTQ+ friendly community. We have multiple links here where you can
                    donate, and you can learn more about the LGBTQ+ community in the About section of our page.
