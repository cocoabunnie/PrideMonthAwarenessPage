Submission: https://pride-month-awareness-page.vercel.app/

Assignment Given:
Choose a cause that your group really cares about and put together a small informational website  using HTML/CSS trying to convince people to donate to or help this cause. This site should be  2-3 pages and look as professional as possible using modern design trends. Research similar  websites to get inspiration. 
Once you have decided on a cause, 
begin by selecting one member to create a Git repo with an 
index.html file, push it to GitHub, and then add the other teammates as collaborators on the repo.  Throughout this workshop, each teammate should be communicating often and using GitHub  effectively. Remember no one should be working off Master so create branches, resolve merge  conflicts, and create and close issues.
